<h3>Common mistakes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only Chosen One can hire new characters. Yes, you can't hire NPC by sending scouts.
<li>If a team producing something, only leader should receive PRODUCE order. Subordinates should not receive any full-turn orders - they are automatically executing same full-turn order with leader.
<li>Person can't learn a new talent. Usual person has 2 talents out of following: "reflexes", "cooking", "survival", "scavenge", "driving", "building".
<li>Rats are produced with PRODUCE RAT order, but you will receive dead rats [RATD] instead of rats [RAT].
</ul>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not hesitate to KICK a person if you can't feed him. The difference from Atlantis is you can't issue WORK order if you don't know what to do with your man.
<li>From the start you'll need as much as possible people with "survival" (avoiding battle) and 1-2 patrollers with "reflexes" to keep them safe. If you are producing rats, you'll soon need a cook to make 3 rations out of one rat.
<li>Beware of radiation. There is one-turn fallout season, when radiation is doubled. 
<li>The climate is nuclear winter. Be prepared to winter colds, build the shelter (barracks will do at first), prepare warm clothes. Think of a way to get burnable items in case that will not be enough.
</ul>
