<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Wasteland is turn-based play by email strategy game. The setting of the game 
  is burnt wastelands in the middle of nuclear winter. The game is open-ended, 
  there is no set objectives or victory conditions: players may choose to scavenge 
  ruined cities, become a patriarchs of farming societies or raid the lands in 
  armed warbands - any way of development is possible. New players may join at 
  any time. </p>
<p>Wasteland based on Atlantis PBEM, but it is not a modified version of Atlantis, 
  it is completely new engine built from scratch.</p>
<h3>What is PBEM</h3>
<p>Wasteland is PBEM (Play By E-Mail) game. If you signed up for the game, you 
  will receive turn reports on your email. Turn report contains complete description 
  of your game situation. Examining the report and interacting with other players, 
  you decide your strategy for this turn and send back to server a message with 
  orders list. Two times a week (or differently, depending on particular game 
  server), server will gather all received orders and generate next game turn; 
  turn reports then again will be sent to players.</p>
<h2><a name="report"></a>Turn report</h2>
<p>Here is the example of one section of turn report:</p>
<div class="report"> 
  <p>wasteland (11,15), Middle Plains<br>
    ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Weather Forecast: clear, 5&deg;C, 10 mR/h.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Junk: 4 dead rats [RATD].<br>
    <br>
  <p>Exits:<br>

<p>Here you can see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Region</b>, or one cell of game map with coordinates (11,15).</li>
  <li><b>Persons</b> in the region. Each person has a <b>Faction</b>, which is 
    his relation to specific player. NPC is the exceptional faction for non-player 
    characters.</li>
  <li><b>Objects</b>: buildings and vehicles in region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regions is hexagonal, so coordinate system may not be clear at first glance:

<h2><a name="persons"></a>Persons detailed</h2>
<h3>Chosen One and hiring</h3>
<p>You start the game with single person - Chosen One. His exceptional gift allowing 
  him to attract and lead people, or, in game terms, hire new persons for your 
  faction. </p>
<p>To hire a person, Chosen must give him some food (executing GIVE order). It 
  may be any minimal value for NPC, or very considerable amount for person already 
  belonging to other faction. Hire fee will not be included in inventory of recruit: 
  it's either eaten immediately, or hidden in reserve. Chosen One can't change 
  faction this way.</p>
<p>You will be informed about exact amounts of food required to outbid a person 
  from your faction, but for other persons this sum is hidden. This sum will be 
  higher if a person is in region or in team with Chosen One, and lower depending 
  on person Insanity and amount of persons in faction.</p>
<p>Another exceptional gift of Chosen One is the ability to see people's strong 
  sides. Talents of all persons in same region with Chosen One will be shown in 
  your report. </p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Unlike Atlantis PBEM, Wasteland has no hex population, and persons will not 
  appear out of nowhere. Natural way of population growth is children. Women which 
  working in team with men has a 50% chance to have baby. This process is not 
  requiring any orders. At first, baby is just an item in mother's inventory. 
  After some turns baby becomes a new person, which has one random father's talent 
  and one mother's. For some turns, though, he will remail &quot;child&quot; which 
  means he will not be able to make his own children. </p>
<h3>Insanity</h3>
<p>Insanity stands for level of moral and physical degradation of person. It may 
  have values from 0 to 10. A person with Insanity 8 counts as dangerously inadequate, 
  and shown as &quot;insane&quot; in turn report. Insane NPC can't be hired and 
  may even attack your subordinates. Insane person in faction can't learn. If 
  Insanity grows to 10, person leaves faction. In addition, Insanity has close 
  connection to the amount of food which should be paid by other Chosen to re-hire 
  your subordinate.</p>
<p>Insanity growing by one, if person had a chance to die (from hunger, radiation, 
  cold or wound), or if there is more than 5 persons in team. It lowers, if person 
  was participated in baby-making, or he was CUREd, or if he is a NPC.</p>
<p>Persons with doctor skill can CURE insanity, using medicine. Doctor with level 
  100 can cure up to 5 patients, but can't lower Insanity of single person by 
  more than 1 per turn.</p>
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>Persons may join a team in command of other persons. Persons in team executing 
  together all movement orders, all full-turn orders, and ATTACK order; all there 
  orders should be given to team leader. If leader has no skill required to execute 
  the order, it wouldn't be executed, even if team has other persons with required 
  skill.</p>
<p>When executing orders, skill of all persons in team are used in total. So, 
  a team with 5 level 50 hunters will have total hunting skill of 250.</p>
<p>If team has more than 5 persons (including leader), they will quarrel and their 
  Insanity will rise.</p>
<h3>Skills and talents</h3>
<p>Each person has a set of skills that determines his successfullness in certain 
  activities. Skills have level from 0 to 100. For example, if one level of &quot;hunter&quot; 
  skill required to catch a rat, a person with hunter 20 will catch 20 rats.</p>
<p>Skills may be based on other skills. In this case, skill level can't be greater 
  than level of prerequisite skill. For example, if &quot;gunsmith&quot; skill 
  is based on &quot;scavenge&quot;, and person has scavenge 10, level of gunsmith 
  may not exceed 10.</p>
<p>Usually a person (except Chosen One) has two talents - base skills which is 
  not based on any other skills. Talents are following skills: reflexes, survival, 
  cooking, driver, building, scavenge. Person can't learn a new talent or a skill 
  which is not based on existing talent.</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>While executing an orders, person develops the skills required for that. Each 
  month he receives 5 experience points and spends it for skill used. For example, 
  if gunsmith with level 10 was making ammo, he raises his level up to 15.</p>
<p>Skill will be raised even if it was not enough to execute the order. For example, 
  a gunsmith with level 0 will not produce an ammo, but will gain level 5 regardless 
  of that (but he still need to execute PRODUCE order and possess the components 
  required to make ammo, to experiment with them).</p>
<p>If skill can't be developed because there is not enough prerequisite skill, 
  experience will be first spent on prerequisite. For example, if in previous 
  situation the person had scavenge 10, he will promote scavenge to 13 and gunsmith 
  to 12.</p>
<p>If a skill is promoted to level 100, person will receive all skills based on 
  this one with level 0.</p>
<h3>Learning in teams</h3>
<p>While working in team, persons are learning from their leader. The leader himself 
  receives 5 xp as usual, but his subordinates receive 15 xp. Skill level of subordinate 
  can't exceed skill level of leader. So, if a subordinate has higher level than 
  his leader, he will not promote it at all (but level will not decrease).</p>
<p>If person's leader uses a skill not known to this person, but available to 
  be learned by him (which means the person has the talent required to learn this 
  skill), the person will receive that skill and spend his expirience on it.</p>
<h3>Deadly dangers</h3>
<p>A person has a chance to die from following reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hunger</li>
  <li>Radiation</li>
  <li>Cold</li>
  <li>Battle wound</li>
</ol>
<p>If person had a chance to die, but survived, his Insanity will grow by 1.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Each person requires 30 rations per turn. Some items may count as more than 
  one ration, for example mushroom counts as 1 ration, giant lizard counts as 
  20 rations. Items are eaten completely during turn, so even if character has 
  2 giant lizards, he will eat both, even if that's 40 rations.</p>
<p>If person has not enough food, he'll borrow from other persons in region. If 
  there is still not enough, he has a chance to die, equal to amount of missed 
  rations (in percents). So, if person eats 28 rations instead of 30, chance to 
  die is 2%.</p>
<h3>Radiation</h3>
<p>Each region of Wastelands has a set level of radiation. Human can safely live 
  in region with radiation level of 100 mR/h. If there is more radiation, there 
  is a chance, equal to overdose amount (radiation-100) that the dose was critical. 
  So, in region with radiation 200, person will 100% have a critical dose.</p>
<p>If a person receives critical dose of radiation, he has 10% chance to die and 
  90% chance to mutate. If mutated, he will immediately receive Insanity 10, leave 
  faction and become a Ghoul. Ghouls are still a type of persons, but they can't 
  learn, even if no more insane. They can safely exist within 90-1000 units of 
  radiation and will die if there is not enough radiation in region. Each Ghoul 
  raises region radiation by additional 1 microroentgen.</p>
<p>In certain buildings, radiation may be either lower or higher than region level. 
  For example, Vault lowers radiation level, and nuclear power plant raising it. 
  In addition, a level for particular person may be lowered or raised by items 
  in his possession; for example, gas masks lowering radiation for owners.</p>
<p>Note that radiation level shown in turn report is a forecast, not an actual 
  value. This means that even radiation is suddenly raised to 250, your subordinates 
  still has a time to run into shelters.</p>
<h3>Cold</h3>
<p>Second important parameter of climate if the temperature. As a rule, it is 
  equal for all regions and changed according to season of the year. Human may 
  safely exist in temperature from 0&deg;Ñ and higher; if temperature drops under 
  0, he has a chance to die equal to degrees below zero, in percents.</p>
<p>Warm clothes and some buildings may protect from some degrees below zero, for 
  example up to -20. If this still not enough, a person may warm himself up by 
  burning wood and other fuel. One unit of fuel required for each degree below 
  zero. Burning fuel is processed like maintenance and does not require special 
  orders. </p>
<p>Note that buildings can protect only a set amount of persons, which comes in 
  turn report first under this building. For example, a tank only protects first 
  4 persons inside - either in battle or from radiation and cold.</p>
<h2><a name="attitudes"></a>Faction attitudes</h2>
<p>Following attitudes defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ally: your patrols will protect ally persons, your persons will automatically 
    share food and fuel with allied ones. Also, all rules for Friendly is applied.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Friendly: friendly characters can GIVE items to yours, enter your buildings 
    and join a team in command of your leaders.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Neutral: no rules.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Unfriendly: your patrols will block the entry to region for unfriendly persons.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Hostile: all persons with no AVOID flag set will ATTACK hostile characters 
    in sight; patrols will attack hostile persons attempting to enter region.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may DECLARE a default attitude for your faction, and specific attitude 
  for any particular faction. Note that if you set someone as Ally, this still 
  doesn't mean he did the same.</p>
<h3>Stealth</h3>
<p>Person may HIDE his faction. In this case, no one will see his faction in any 
  case, and all other persons will apply to him their default attitude.</p>
<h2><a name="actions"></a>Possible actions</h2>
<h3>Regular movement</h3>
<p>When a person is ordered to MOVE, any amount of directions may be supplied 
  as parameters, and person will move until all directions is completed. Since 
  regions are hexagonal, usually there is six exits: N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW. </p>
<p>In perfect conditions, a person is able to walk 2 regions per turn, spending 
  one movement point (MP) per region. Terrain of some regions may be more difficult: 
  2 MP is needed to enter these regions, so person can walk only one region per 
  turn. For example, burned forest and ruined city are difficult terrains.</p>
<p>Person can't walk if overloaded. Regular man can carry up to 50 kg. Calculated 
  load of person is appearing in turn report as &quot;load&quot; string. Weight 
  of each particular item is shown in Item Reports section.</p>
<p>Persons also may move into objects and leave objects during movement. Note 
  that ENTER and LEAVE orders may be also used for that. Since these orders is 
  executed before MOVE and DRIVE, it may be more convenient to use them to enter 
  and leave vehicles.</p>
<h3>Transporting</h3>
<p>Driving trucks, cars, and other vehicles is processed in similar way to MOVE, 
  but instead of MOVE you should issue DRIVE order. Speed of vehicle, or amount 
  of MP available to it, is depending on particular vehicle type.</p>
<p>Usually a vehicle requires gasoline to be driven. One unit of gasoline
  is required to drive by one region. Gasoline must present in inventory of the
  driver.</p>
<p>Vehicle is moving all persons inside with it, if sum of their weight is not 
  exceeding vehicle's capacity. Persons which are not driving vehicle on the way 
  may execute different orders in same turn.</p>
<p>Some types of terrain is impassable for land vehicles, like burned forest.</p>
<h3>Patrols</h3>
<p>A person can patrol a region. While doing it, he will block entry to region 
  to unfriendly and hostile persons, and also will protect attacked persons from 
  same or allied faction.</p>
<p>In patrol, a person is developing his combat skills. If a person also participated 
  in combat, he still receives experience once per turn.</p>
<h3>Barter</h3>
<p>A person may trade with other persons. He may set a price for any of his items 
  with TRADE command. If other person in region, regardless of that person's faction, 
  also received TRADE order, and the conditions is matching with first one's, 
  the items will be exchanged. Otherwise, the offer will remain unclosed and will 
  be shown in turn reports of other players.</p>
<p>For example, a person is trading 10 rats in exchange to 20 ammo. The price 
  is 2 ammo per rat. If other character in region wants to trade 6 ammo for 3 
  rats, the deal will be done and second offer will be closed. If other person 
  will offer 3 ammo for 1 rat, deal still will be done, but first person will 
  receive 3 ammo, not 2 as requested. If 1 ammo was offered for 1 rat, there is 
  no deal.</p>
<h3>Scavenging</h3>
<p>A person with &quot;scavenge&quot; skill can execute SCAVENGE order, picking 
  an items from region's Junk. For each level of scavenge, person can take one 
  item. </p>
<h3>Producing</h3>
<p>Many items may be produced by PRODUCE order. For example, if a person received 
  PRODUCE &quot;grilled rats&quot; order, he will make grilled rats, in case he 
  has enough cooking skill and enough dead rats to begin with.</p>
<p>A raw materials required to make some items. In last example, we needed dead 
  rats to produce grilled rats. There is a cases when one item requires multiple 
  raw materials, and a cases when multiple items may be produced from one unit 
  of raw material.</p>
<p>If an item doesn't require raw material to produce, it is called &quot;resource&quot; 
  and produced from region's Resources (for example, if rats are exist in region, 
  person can catch them). If multiple teams are producing same resource in region, 
  the amount produced will be distributed between teams depending on their skill 
  level. </p>
<p>The higher the skill level, the better a person will produce. For example, 
  30 rats could e produced by 10 level 3 hunters, or by one level 30 hunter. Some 
  items require sertain level just to make one unit: for example, to make one 
  ammo, gunsmith 5 is required. In this case, gunsmith 100 will produce 20 ammo 
  per turn.</p>
<h3> Building objects</h3>
<p>Objects (buildings and vehicles) often consist of multiple amounts of different 
  materials. For example, an incomplete tank:</p>
<p>+ Panzer MK [123], tank [TANK], 3 car details [DETA]. Needs: 37 car details 
  [DETA], engine [ENGI].</p>
<p>needs 37 car details and 1 engine to be installed. </p>
<p>To build an object from the ground, BUILD order should be issued. First materials 
  in object's list is required for that (in last example that was car details), 
  and the person should have a skill to INSTALL them.</p>
<p>To continue building of started object, a person should INSTALL the needed 
  parts, being inside that object. Note that sequential BUILD order will start 
  another one object instead of continuing this one. </p>
<p>Optional blocks could be installed in some objects (usually that's weapons). 
  You can install only one optional variant - for example, for tank that will 
  be either up to 2 autoguns or up to 2 flamethrowers. The list of required and 
  optional materials is shown in Object Reports section.</p>
<h3>Uninstalling components</h3>
<p>A materials installed in objects may be uninstalled from there with UNINSTALL 
  order. To complete that, a person needs similar skill that to INSTALL this material, 
  but only one level is required to uninstall any component. The uninstalling 
  person, or person from same faction, must own object.</p>
<h2><a name="warfare"></a>Warfare</h2>
<h3>Where and when the battle begins</h3>
<p>Battle begins in following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A person ATTACKing other person.</li>
  <li>Persons with no AVOID flag set automatically attacking any hostile persons.</li>
  <li>Patrols will attack any hostile persons trying to enter the region.</li>
  <li>A person with MOVE ATTACK or DRIVE ATTACK order will attack patrols if they 
    trying to block the way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who will fight<br>
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Either the persons and their teams from single region which are ATTACKed 
    same target, or single person and his team in other cases.</li>
  <li>Attacked person and his team.</li>
  <li> Patrols of attacked and allied factions from same region.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rounds</h3>
<p>The combat is processed in rounds. In each round, each fighter has a chance 
  to make a move (shoot, assault, flee, etc). But, if anyone on battlefield has 
  a ranged weapon, all fighters with melee weapons lose their attack in first round.
  In that case, only possible actions in first round is shooting or running away.</p>
<p>Fighters act in order determined 
  by &quot;reflexes&quot; talent: ones with higher reflexes will act first.</p>

<h3>Attacks</h3>

<p>Attacks in close combat or shots is 
  processed by following sequence:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rolling to hit. The chance to hit the target is depending on shooter's weapon 
    skill: if skill level is 50, it will be 50%.</li>
  <li>If both attacker and defender has melee weapon, there is a roll to block 
    the hit. Block probability is equal to defender's weapon skill.</li>
  <li>If a target has bulletproof jacket or other armor, follows armor save roll. 
    The chance to save depends on type of armor.</li>
  <li>Rolling to wound. Chance to wound depends on weapon type.</li>
  <li>If the hit is connected, fighter is out of action. But, there is still a 
    chance that he is survived. The chance to survive depends on weapon's lethality 
    factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Particular weapons can apply a modifiers to different rolls: for example, machine 
  gun lowers hit probability, and shotgun is raises armor save probability.</p>
<p>For each roll there is 1% chance to pass and 1% chance to fail, even if it 
  is impossible. So, a level 100 sniper will actually hit 99% targets.</p>
<p>Persons without weapon or weapon skill can't attack and will flee as soon as 
  possible. </p>
<h3>Fleeing</h3>
<p>A person will flee in following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He has AVOID flag set</li>
  <li>He has no weapon or no skill to use weapon </li>
  <li>He is ran out of ammo</li>
  <li>He uses explosives and either has no targets to blow up or already set his 
    bomb </li>
  <li>In previous round (if it wasn't first round) his side wasn't able to make 
    at least one attack, either successful or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actual fleeing will be committed in person's turn in reflexes order, but from 
  the start of the turn fleeing person can't be target of ranged weapons, in case 
  when there is still someone fighting on his side. So, a person with AVOID flag 
  has good chance to run away in first round if a patrolling shooter is covering 
  him. </p>
<h3>Incapacitated persons</h3>
<p>If person was incapacitated, AVOID flag will be set for him automatically. 
  Therefore, he will not participate in further battles this turn, even if ordered 
  to patrol. The flag may be reset as usual.</p>
<h3>Buildings and vehicles</h3>
<p>A person inside an object can't be target of ranged weapons. If he is assaulting 
  with melee weapon, he is going out of cover. An opponent with melee weapon can 
  attack fighters inside objects without any penalties.</p>
<h3>&quot;Watch out, comrade!&quot;</h3>
<p>Chosen One can't be target of ranged or melee weapons, if there is at least 
  one fighter on his side, even fleeing. His comrades will cover him at any cost.</p>
<h3>Victory and spoils</h3>
<p>The battle is ended when one side has all persons out of action or fleed. Also, 
  a battle may end as a draw after 50 rounds. </p>
<p>If there is a winner, his soldiers may collect the spoils. Spoils are cases 
  from shot ammo, and all items of killed and incapacitated (but not fleed) fighters. 
</p>
<p>Spoils are taken by following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If preferences are set for this person by SPOILS order, maximum amount of 
    one of given item types will be taken. For example, if person was ordered 
    to take handguns and knives, he will take either max amount of handguns or 
    maximum amount of knives - depending on what was first in SPOILS order.</li>
  <li>If no preferences was given, or none of preferred spoils found, person will 
    just take some random items.</li>
</ul>
<p>A person will not take more items than he can carry. If spoils have zero weight, 
  random amount will be taken. All uncollected spoils, excluding items of incapacitated 
  but survived fighters, is falling to region Junk.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Persons participated in battle are developing their combat skills. Note that 
  if team leader developed some particular skill, all his subordinates will also 
  develop that skill, even if they have different type of weapons.</p>
<h3>Weapon characteristics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ammo.</b> Many types of weapons require ammo, which is spent on each 
    shot - for example, 9mm ammo for pistol. Ammo must exist in person's inventory. 
    When all ammo is spent, person will flee. Shot cases will be picked up by 
    winners.</li>
  <li><b>Heavy weapons</b> must be mounted on building or vehicle, and shooter 
    must be inside the object to use it. If a person has heavy weapon in his inventory, 
    he will not be able to use it.</li>
  <li><b>Anti-tank weapons</b> first target vehicles and buildings of opposite 
    side. Each object has set amount of hit points, which must be lowered to 0 
    by hits from this type of weapon to destroy the object. If there are no objects 
    on battlefield, shooter begins to target separate characters. In that case, 
    if roll to hit was successful, the target is immediately killed - all further 
    rolls are skipped. &quot;To wound&quot; characteristic of this type of weapon 
    is applied only to objects.</li>
  <li><b>Explosive weapons</b> (bombs) may target only buildings and vehicles. 
    Miner's skill is tested twice: first to make successful placement of the bomb, 
    and second to run away from explosion. After explosion, the object is destroyed 
    and all persons inside suffering automatic hit with no armor save and wound 
    chance equal to bomb to wound characteristic.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="orders"></a>Orders format</h2>
<p>To give an orders to your units, you need to send a mail to server address 
  containing following lines:</p>
<p>#orders &lt;faction number&gt; &lt;password&gt;<br>
  person &lt;number&gt;<br>
  ...orders...<br>
  person &lt;number&gt;<br>
  ...orders...<br>
  #end<br>
</p>
<p>For example, if your faction number is 27, and you have two persons - 5 and 
  17, your orders may look like this:</p>
<p>#orders 27 &quot;password&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>person 5<br>

<p>Orders for each person must start with PERSON keyword. Any order must be addressed 
  to one of your characters. If an order is not directly related to any character, 
  like NAME FACTION order, this order may be given to any person in faction.</p>
<p>Order parser is case-insensitive, so you may use either lowercase or uppercase.</p>
<p>Detailed order list is located in file reference.html</p>
<h3>Repeating orders</h3>
<p>If @ sign is supplied as first character of order (for example, &quot;@move 
  N NW&quot;), this order will apperar in Orders Template section or your next 
  report. This is useful if you want a person to execute same orders each turn.</p>
<h3>Abbreviations<br>
</h3>
<p>All items and skills has short names (for example, metal constructions [CONS]). 
  When issuing an order, you may use either full or short name. So, order PRODUCE 
  &quot;metal constructions&quot; is equivalent to PRODUCE CONS. Note that full 
  names should usually be enclosed in quotes.</p>
<h3>Instant and full-turn orders</h3>
<p>Most orders doesn't require long time to execute - you may issue as many orders 
  of this type as you want. But, each person may receive only one order, which 
  determines his actions for whole turn (like MOVE or PRODUCE). If two or more 
  full-turn orders issued, person will execute only last one.</p>
